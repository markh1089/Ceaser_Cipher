                The "Caesar Box," or "Caesar Cipher," is one of the earliest known ciphers. Developed around 100 BC, it
                was
                used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his generals in the field. In the event that one of his
                messages got intercepted, his opponent could not read them.<br><br>

                Caesar shifted each letter of his message three letters to the right to produce what could be called the
                ciphertext. The ciphertext is what the enemy would see instead of the true message. So, for example, if
                Caesar’s messages were written in the English alphabet, each letter “A” in the message would become a
                "D,"
                the "B’s" would become "E’s," and the "X's" become "A’s." This type of cipher is appropriately called a
                “shift cipher.”<br><br>

                Caesar’s magic number was three, however, a modern day use of the Caesar Cipher is a code called
                "ROT13."
                ROT13, short for "rotate by 13 places," shifts each letter of the English alphabet 13 spaces. It is
                often
                used in online forums to hide information such as movie and tv show spoilers, solutions to puzzles or
                games,
                or offensive material. The code is easily crackable, however, it hides the information from the quick
                glance.</p>
